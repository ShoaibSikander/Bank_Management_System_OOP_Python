# OOP_with_Python

This repository is made for every student who is struggling with Object Oriented Programming concepts and to implement those in Python. I have attended an online course on 'Udemy' which names 'Python OOP: Four Pillars of OOP in Python 3 for Beginners' taught by 'Febin George'. During this course, instructor explained the core concepts of OOP in a very simple way and also implemented those in Python3. After each section, an exercise problem is given by instructor so that learner can implement the concepts learned in lecture videos. Taking this course was really a great experience as it cleared many of my confusions and gave me a good grip on implementing OOP in Python3.

In this paragraph, I'll explain the structure of this repository for easiness of any person trying to learn from this repository. 'Python OOP' folder contains all the data for this course in 4 folders. '1-Lecture Notes' contains PDF files of 5 different lectues. Corresponding to each lecture, there are exercise problems and solutions in respective folders. At the end, most of the core concepts are implemented in a Mini-Project in last folder. This Mini-Project implemenets a 'Bank Management System'. Purpose of this Mini-Project is not to make some state of the art program, instead it focuses on implementing OOP concepts in a simplest possible way.
